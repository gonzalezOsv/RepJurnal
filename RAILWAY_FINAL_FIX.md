# Railway Final Fix - Database Variables

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your code was looking for `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, etc., but Railway provides `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`, etc.

**I've updated your code to automatically detect Railway's variable names!**

## 🚀 Push This Fix (30 Seconds)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\1212\Documents\Projects\fitnesDiary

git add .

git commit -m "fix: Auto-detect Railway MySQL variable names"

git push origin main
```

Railway will redeploy automatically!

## 📋 Your Railway Variables (Simple Version)

**In Railway, you ONLY need to set these 3 variables:**

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=paste-your-64-char-secret-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=paste-your-64-char-jwt-secret-here
AUTO_INIT_DB=true
```

**That's it!** Railway's MySQL service automatically provides:
- ✅ `MYSQL_HOST`
- ✅ `MYSQL_PORT`
- ✅ `MYSQL_DATABASE`
- ✅ `MYSQL_USER`
- ✅ `MYSQL_PASSWORD`

Your app now automatically reads these!

---

## 🔑 Generate Your Secret Keys

If you haven't already:

```powershell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Run this **twice** to get two different 64-character keys.

**Copy-paste each result into Railway:**
1. First result → `SECRET_KEY`
2. Second result → `JWT_SECRET_KEY`

---

## ✅ After Pushing

1. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for Railway to rebuild
2. **Check deployment logs** - should see:
   ```
   📊 Built database URI from components: mysql+pymysql://root:***@mysql.railway.internal:3306/railway
   ✅ Database connection established
   AUTO_INIT_DB is enabled. Initializing database for production...
   Database initialized successfully!
   Starting Flask application in production environment on port XXXX
   ```

3. **Visit your Railway URL**
4. **Try to register** a new account
5. **✅ It should work!**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
```python
db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')  # ❌ Not found in Railway
```

### After:
```python
db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST') or os.getenv('MYSQL_HOST')  # ✅ Railway compatible!
```

Now your app checks **both** naming conventions!

## 📊 Expected Railway Variables (Auto-Provided)

**MySQL service automatically provides:**

| Variable | Example Value | Provided By |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `MYSQL_HOST` | `containers-us-west-xx.railway.app` | Railway MySQL |
| `MYSQL_PORT` | `3306` | Railway MySQL |
| `MYSQL_DATABASE` | `railway` | Railway MySQL |
| `MYSQL_USER` | `root` | Railway MySQL |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | `generated-password` | Railway MySQL |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `mysql://root:pass@host:3306/railway` | Railway MySQL |

**You manually set in web service:**

| Variable | You Provide |
|----------|-------------|
| `FLASK_ENV` | `production` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Your 64-char key |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Your 64-char key |
| `AUTO_INIT_DB` | `true` (first deploy) |

## 🔍 How It Works Now

```
1. Railway MySQL service starts
   ↓ (auto-provides MYSQL_* variables)
2. Your web service starts
   ↓ (reads MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_USER, etc.)
3. App builds connection string automatically
   ↓ (mysql://user:pass@host/database)
4. Connects to database ✅
   ↓
5. Creates tables (AUTO_INIT_DB=true)
   ↓
6. App is live! 🎉
```

---

## ⚙️ If Still Not Working

Check that MySQL service is running:

1. In Railway dashboard, click **MySQL service**
2. Look for green dot (running status)
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Verify these exist:
   - MYSQL_HOST
   - MYSQL_USER
   - MYSQL_PASSWORD
   - MYSQL_DATABASE

If any are missing, MySQL service isn't fully provisioned. Wait 60 seconds and refresh.

## 📝 After First Successful Deploy

**Important!** Change this variable:

```env
AUTO_INIT_DB=false
```

This prevents recreating tables on every deploy.
