# ✅ Git Branching Strategy - Setup Complete!

## 🌳 Your Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Current State |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **`main`** | Production (Railway) | ✅ Ready to deploy |
| **`dev`** | Local development | ✅ Active - Work here! |

---

## 🎯 You Are Currently On: `dev`

Check anytime with:
```powershell
git branch
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Run Locally NOW

Since you're on `dev` branch, you can run locally immediately:

```powershell
cd workout-diary
.\setup-local.ps1
```

**Open:** http://localhost:5000  
**Login:** `tom101` / `vL5MYe7HdD4bhmY##`

---

## 💡 Daily Workflow

### **Morning - Start Working:**
```powershell
git checkout dev  # Make sure you're on dev
git pull origin dev  # Get latest changes
```

### **During the Day - Make Changes:**
```powershell
# Edit code, test locally...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
```

### **End of Day - Save Work:**
```powershell
git push origin dev  # Backup your work
```

### **Ready to Deploy? - Push to Production:**
```powershell
git checkout main  # Switch to production branch
git merge dev  # Merge your dev work
git push origin main  # Deploy to Railway!
```

### **Back to Development:**
```powershell
git checkout dev  # Switch back to dev
```

---

## 📊 What's Different Between Branches?

### **`dev` Branch (Current):**
- ✅ `.env.dev` file (tracked) - Local database config
- ✅ Local development scripts
- ✅ Test data automatically loaded
- ✅ All documentation files
- ✅ Development-friendly settings

### **`main` Branch:**
- ✅ Production-ready code only
- ✅ No `.env` file (uses Railway variables)
- ✅ Railway deployment configuration
- ✅ Stable, tested code

---

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### **On `dev` Branch (Local):**

**File: `workout-diary/.env.dev`** (auto-copied to `.env`)
```env
FLASK_ENV=development
DB_HOST=db  # Docker container
DB_NAME=fitness_tracker
```

### **On `main` Branch (Production):**

**Railway Dashboard → Variables**
```env
FLASK_ENV=production
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQLHOST}}  # Railway MySQL
DB_NAME=railway
```

---

## 🎨 Typical Workflow Example

### **Monday: Start Feature**
```powershell
git checkout dev
# Work on code...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add workout charts"
```

### **Tuesday: Continue**
```powershell
# Still on dev
# More work...
git add .
git commit -m "style: improve chart colors"
```

### **Wednesday: Test Locally**
```powershell
cd workout-diary
.\setup-local.ps1
# Test at http://localhost:5000
```

### **Thursday: Deploy to Production**
```powershell
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main  # Railway auto-deploys!
```

### **Friday: Back to Dev**
```powershell
git checkout dev
# Start new features...
```
