# ✅ Railway Docker Build Fix

## 🔧 Problem Fixed!

**The Issue:** Railway was trying to build using `workout-diary/Dockerfile` but couldn't find `requirements.txt` because the Docker build context wasn't set correctly.

**The Error:**
```
ERROR: "/requirements.txt": not found
```

**The Fix:** Updated `railway.json` to specify both the Dockerfile path AND the build context.

---

## ✅ What I Changed

### Before:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  }
}
```

Railway tried to use the workout-diary Dockerfile but looked for files in the root directory.

### After:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "dockerfilePath": "workout-diary/Dockerfile",
    "dockerContext": "workout-diary"
  }
}
```

Now Railway knows:
1. **Which Dockerfile to use:** `workout-diary/Dockerfile`
2. **Where to look for files:** Inside the `workout-diary/` folder

---

## 🚀 Code is Already Pushed!

I just pushed the fix to GitHub:
```
✅ Commit: ad3cb1f - fix: Set Railway docker context to workout-diary folder
✅ Pushed to: main branch
```

Railway should automatically detect the push and start a new deployment.

---

## ⏱️ What Happens Next

1. **Railway detects the push** (5-10 seconds)
2. **Starts building** (30-60 seconds)
3. **Deployment succeeds!** ✅

The build should take **under 2 minutes** now (much faster than 6 minutes).

## 🔍 Check Railway Now

Go to Railway → Your project → Deployments

**You should see:**

### Build Logs:
```
✅ Step 1: FROM python:3.11-slim-bullseye
✅ Step 2: WORKDIR /app
✅ Step 3: Installing system dependencies...
✅ Step 4: COPY requirements.txt . (WORKS NOW!)
✅ Step 5: Installing Python packages...
✅ Step 6: COPY . .
✅ Build complete!
```

### Deploy Logs:

## ✅ Expected Timeline

| Time | What's Happening |
|------|------------------|
| 0:00 | Railway detects GitHub push |
| 0:05 | Build starts |
| 0:30 | Installing dependencies |
| 1:00 | Copying application files |
| 1:15 | Build complete, starting deployment |
| 1:30 | Database initialization |
| 1:45 | **App is live!** ✅ |

**Total time: ~2 minutes**

## 🎯 After Deployment Succeeds

**Don't forget to add your Railway variables!** (If you haven't already)

Go to Railway → Your web service → Variables → Add these:

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=75db75192f2df8e84656dbc498e5a4fbc1bd6692f21b5428395fe85f38f73666
JWT_SECRET_KEY=fa8f930050753b2d9b53a9a0e882b6bb1bb780695da3bd0fc5bac9ee295e28ae
AUTO_INIT_DB=true
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_USER=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
DB_NAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}
```

**Then it will redeploy again with the database connected!**

---

## 📖 Why The Docker Context Matters

**Docker Build Context:** The directory Docker uses as the "root" when executing COPY commands.

**Without `dockerContext`:**
```
Dockerfile says: COPY requirements.txt .
Railway looks in: /repo-root/requirements.txt ❌ (not found)
```

**With `dockerContext: "workout-diary"`:**
```
Dockerfile says: COPY requirements.txt .
Railway looks in: /repo-root/workout-diary/requirements.txt ✅ (found!)
```

---

## 🆘 If Build Still Fails

**Check Railway logs for:**

### 1. Still can't find requirements.txt?
```bash
# In Railway web UI → Settings → check:
# - "Root Directory" should be empty or "workout-diary"
# - "Dockerfile Path" should be "workout-diary/Dockerfile"
```

### 2. Build succeeds but app crashes?
That means database variables aren't set. Go add the 8 variables from the "After Deployment" section above.

### 3. Different error?
Share the error message and I'll help!
