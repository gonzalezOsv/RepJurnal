# Railway Complete Setup Guide

## üöÄ How Railway Works (Simple Explanation)

After you push to GitHub, Railway:
1. **Automatically builds** your app from the Dockerfile
2. **Automatically starts** the app (no manual start needed!)
3. **Automatically connects** to the database using environment variables
4. **Gives you a URL** to access your app

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub ‚úÖ

You'll do this first (use the Git commands I provided earlier).

---

### Step 2: Create Railway Project (5 minutes)

1. Go to **[railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. Click **"Login with GitHub"** (free, no credit card needed)
3. Click **"Start a New Project"**
4. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Select your repository:** `fitnesDiary`
6. Railway will **automatically start building!**

**What happens automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Railway finds your root `Dockerfile`
- ‚úÖ Builds the Docker image
- ‚úÖ Starts the container
- ‚úÖ Your app runs!

---

### Step 3: Add MySQL Database (2 minutes)

**In your Railway project:**

1. Click **"+ New"** button
2. Select **"Database"**
3. Choose **"MySQL"**
4. Railway creates the database **instantly!**

**Railway automatically generates:**
- Database host
- Database port
- Database name
- Database user
- Database password

---

### Step 4: Connect App to Database (3 minutes)

**Railway uses environment variable references** - super easy!

1. Click on your **web service** (the main app, not the database)
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"Raw Editor"** (easier to paste)
4. Paste this (Railway will auto-fill the database values):

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=paste-your-generated-secret-key-here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=paste-your-generated-jwt-secret-key-here
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_PORT=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_NAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USER=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}}
```

**Generate your secret keys first:**
```bash
# Open Python and run this TWICE to get two different keys
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

**Important:** The `${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}` syntax tells Railway to automatically use the MySQL service's values!

---

### Step 5: Get Your App URL (1 minute)

**In your Railway project:**

1. Click on your **web service**
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Domains"** section
4. Click **"Generate Domain"**

**Railway gives you a FREE URL like:**
```
https://fitness-tracker-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

**Or something like:**
```
https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

**This is your app's public URL!** Share it with your beta testers.

---

## üîó How Database Connection Works

### Automatic Connection

Your app's code already reads environment variables:

```python
# In your app, this code already exists:
db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')
db_port = os.getenv('DB_PORT')
db_name = os.getenv('DB_NAME')
db_user = os.getenv('DB_USER')
db_password = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
```

**Railway injects these values automatically** when you use `${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}` syntax!

### Connection String Example

Railway builds a connection like this:
```
mysql://user:password@host:port/database_name
```

**You don't have to do anything!** Railway handles it all.

---

## üåê Using Your Own Domain

### If You Already Own a Domain

Railway makes this **super easy**!

#### Step 1: Add Custom Domain in Railway

1. In your Railway project, click your **web service**
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab
3. Scroll to **"Domains"** section
4. Click **"Add Custom Domain"**
5. Enter your domain: `fitness.yourdomain.com` or `app.yourdomain.com`

#### Step 2: Update DNS Records

Railway will show you DNS records to add. You'll need to add a **CNAME record**:

**Example for `fitness.yourdomain.com`:**

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | fitness | your-app-production-xxxx.up.railway.app | 3600 |

**Or for root domain `yourdomain.com`:**

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | @ | your-app-production-xxxx.up.railway.app | 3600 |

**Where to add this:**
- Go to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Find DNS settings
- Add the CNAME record Railway shows you
- Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS to propagate

#### Step 3: SSL Certificate (Automatic!)

Railway automatically provisions a **free SSL certificate** for your custom domain!

**Your domain will be:**
```
https://fitness.yourdomain.com  ‚Üê Secure with SSL!
```

---

## üéØ Complete Domain Setup Examples

### Example 1: Subdomain (Recommended)

**Your domain:** `example.com`  
**Use for app:** `fitness.example.com`

**Railway setup:**
1. Add custom domain: `fitness.example.com`
2. Railway shows: "Add CNAME record: `fitness` ‚Üí `your-app.up.railway.app`"
3. Add to your DNS provider
4. Wait 10-30 minutes
5. ‚úÖ Works at `https://fitness.example.com`

### Example 2: Root Domain

**Your domain:** `fitnessapp.com`  
**Use for app:** `fitnessapp.com` (no subdomain)

**Railway setup:**
1. Add custom domain: `fitnessapp.com`
2. Railway shows: "Add CNAME/ALIAS record"
3. Some DNS providers require ALIAS instead of CNAME for root
4. Add to your DNS provider
5. ‚úÖ Works at `https://fitnessapp.com`

### Example 3: Multiple Domains

You can add **both** Railway's domain AND your custom domain:

- `https://your-app.up.railway.app` (Railway's free domain)
- `https://fitness.yourdomain.com` (Your custom domain)

Both work! Great for testing before switching over.

---

## üîç How to Access Your App

### After Deployment

1. **Railway URL:** Click "Open App" in Railway dashboard
2. **Custom Domain:** Visit your domain after DNS propagates
3. **Both work!** Use whichever you prefer

### Initial Setup

First time visiting, you'll see your homepage. You can:
- **Register** a new account
- **Use test users** (if you loaded test data):
  - Username: `tom101`
  - Password: `vL5MYe7HdD4bhmY##`

   - **Host, Port, Username, Password**

### Connection URLs

Railway provides multiple formats:

**MySQL URL format:**
```
mysql://user:password@host:port/database
```

**Private network (faster, used by your app):**
```
mysql://root:password@mysql.railway.internal:3306/railway
```

**Public (for external tools):**
```
mysql://root:password@containers-us-west-xx.railway.app:3306/railway
