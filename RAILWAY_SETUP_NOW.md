# üöÄ Railway Setup - Do This Now!

## ‚úÖ Your Code is Already Pushed!

The fix is in your GitHub repo. Now you just need to **configure Railway variables**.

## üìã Step-by-Step Railway Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Your Secret Keys

Open PowerShell and run this **twice**:

```powershell
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

**Copy both results** - you'll need them in step 3.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Go to Railway Dashboard

1. Open [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click your project
3. Click your **web service** (the one running your app, NOT the MySQL service)
4. Click the **"Variables"** tab at the top

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add These 8 Variables

Click **"New Variable"** for each one:

| Variable Name | Value | Notes |
|---------------|-------|-------|
| `FLASK_ENV` | `production` | Type exactly as shown |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Paste first 64-char key from step 1 | Your generated key |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Paste second 64-char key from step 1 | Your other generated key |
| `AUTO_INIT_DB` | `true` | Type exactly: true |
| `DB_HOST` | `${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}` | Type exactly with ${{...}} |
| `DB_USER` | `${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}` | Type exactly with ${{...}} |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | `${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}` | Type exactly with ${{...}} |
| `DB_NAME` | `${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}` | Type exactly with ${{...}} |

**Important:** For the last 4 variables (`DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`), type the `${{...}}` syntax **exactly** as shown. Railway will automatically replace them with real values from your MySQL service.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Deploy"

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variables. Wait 30-60 seconds.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check Deployment Logs

Click **"Deployments"** ‚Üí Latest deployment ‚Üí **"Deploy Logs"**

**Look for these SUCCESS messages:**

```
üìä Built database URI from components: mysql+pymysql://root:***@mysql.railway.internal:3306/railway
‚úÖ Database connection established
AUTO_INIT_DB is enabled. Initializing database for production...
Database initialized successfully!
Starting Flask application in production environment on port XXXX
```

**If you see these ‚úÖ logs**, your app is live!

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Test Your App

1. Click the URL Railway provides (looks like: `your-app.up.railway.app`)
2. Try to **register** a new account
3. Try to **log in**
4. Try to **log a workout**

**If it all works:** üéâ Success!

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Change AUTO_INIT_DB to False

**After your first successful deploy:**

1. Go back to **Variables**
2. Find `AUTO_INIT_DB`
3. Change value from `true` to `false`
4. Save

This prevents recreating database tables on every deploy.

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Still getting "Database URI components missing"?

**Check that MySQL service exists:**

1. In Railway, go to your **project** (not web service)
2. You should see TWO services:
   - Your web service (Flask app)
   - MySQL service

If MySQL service is missing:
1. Click **"+ New"**
2. Select **"Database"** ‚Üí **"MySQL"**
3. Wait 60 seconds for it to provision
4. Go back to **step 3** above

### Variables not working?

Double-check the syntax:
- ‚úÖ Correct: `${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `${MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}` (missing second brace)
- ‚ùå Wrong: `{{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}` (missing $)
- ‚ùå Wrong: `$MySQL.MYSQL_HOST` (missing braces)

---

## ‚ö° Quick Reference

**Your Railway web service needs exactly these 8 variables:**

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-64-char-key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-generated-64-char-key  
AUTO_INIT_DB=true
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_USER=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
DB_NAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}
```

---

## üéØ Why This Works

**Railway MySQL service provides:**
- MYSQL_HOST
- MYSQL_USER
- MYSQL_PASSWORD
- MYSQL_DATABASE

**Your web service can't see them directly.**

**Solution:** Create `DB_*` variables that **reference** the MySQL variables using `${{MySQL.VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax.

**Your code then reads:**
```python
db_host = os.getenv('DB_HOST')  # Railway injects actual value here!
```

- [ ] Railway redeployed automatically
- [ ] Checked logs - saw ‚úÖ success messages
- [ ] Visited app URL
- [ ] Registration works
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Changed AUTO_INIT_DB to false
