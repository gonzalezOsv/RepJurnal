---

## üìã Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ GitHub account
- ‚úÖ Railway account (free) - [railway.app](https://railway.app)

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Prepare Your Project

### 1.1 Update Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file is NOT in GitHub (already protected by `.gitignore`).

Create a `railway.json` file (optional, for configuration):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",
    "dockerfilePath": "workout-diary/Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 1.2 Update docker-compose for Production

Create `workout-diary/docker-compose.prod.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=${DB_ROOT_PASSWORD}
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=${DB_NAME}
      - MYSQL_USER=${DB_USER}
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mysql_data:
```

FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret-key-change-this

# Database (Railway auto-generates these when you add MySQL)
# Copy from MySQL service's "Connect" tab:
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_PORT=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_NAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}
DB_USER=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}}
```

**Important:** Generate new SECRET_KEY values using:

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Common issues:
# 1. Missing environment variables
# 2. Database connection failed

```

### Database Connection Failed
```bash
# Verify these variables match MySQL service:
# - DB_HOST
# - DB_PORT
# - DB_USER
# - DB_PASSWORD
```

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update feature X"
git push origin main

# 2. Railway automatically deploys!
# 3. Check deployment status in Railway dashboard
```
