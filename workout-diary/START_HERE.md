## 🚀 FIRST STEPS (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Run Security Scanner (2 minutes)

```bash
cd workout-diary
python scripts/security_check.py
```

This will show you the immediate issues in your environment.

### Step 2: Generate Strong Secrets (5 minutes)

```bash
# Generate SECRET_KEY
python3 -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Generate JWT_SECRET_KEY  
python3 -c "import secrets; print('JWT_SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### Step 3: Create .env File (5 minutes)

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and paste the secrets you just generated.

### Step 4: Change Database Passwords (5 minutes)

In `.env`, change:
```
DB_PASSWORD=choose_a_strong_password_min_20_chars
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=choose_a_very_strong_root_password_min_24_chars
```

### Step 5: Restart Application (2 minutes)

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```
